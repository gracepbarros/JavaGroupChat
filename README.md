# JavaGroupChat

A project developed with my colleague Dafni Paiva to build a group chat where users can send text messages, reply to messages, and add reactions to the messages.

In class this was genarted with javafx GUI, but I am implementing a new GUI for this project.

Classes are following the Assignment guidelines. Three classes and one enum is implemented:
1. Class Message - the message itself with its text, username, id and reactions list.
2. Class GroupChat - the group chat with users, their messages and reactions.
3. Enum Reaction - a list of possible reactions for the messages. 
4. _Ongoing_ Class GroupChatGUI - an GUI implementation for usability of the group chat. There is one implemented with javafx that is to be replaced. 
5. _Ongoing_ Class Reply - a class extended from message where it is still a message, but related to another message.
